<h1 class="heading">Welcome to Andrei Apps!</h1>
<h1 class="paragraph">My name is Andrei and here I will post every app I make<br> You can find my apps in the "Apps" menu</h1>
<h1 class="paragraph">Note: you can't download Password Generator for Mac sadly, but I will fix it soon.</h1>
<h1 class="paragraph">Note for MacOS users: when you download the DMG file for Pong, you need to open it, drag Pong to the Applications folder that is inside the thing that popped up when you opened the file, then, in Finder, go to your Applications folder, right click Pong and click open, then after that you will be able to launch Pong normally. You have to do this because MacOS sees the app as potential malware because it's not verified because verification costs money and I'm making apps as a hobby so I don't want to pay to be verified.</h1>
