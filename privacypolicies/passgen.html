<title>Password Generator 2023 privacy policy</title>
</head>
<h1 class="paragraph">I am committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe password generation experience for all ages. My password generator does not collect or store any personal data from users. The passwords generated by the tool are saved only locally on your device as a text file.

The saved passwords are not transmitted or shared with any third-party services, and I do not request any information from users, such as name, email address, or location. I also do not use cookies or track user activity for advertising or other purposes.

It is the responsibility of the user to ensure the security and confidentiality of the locally saved passwords. I recommend that you store the text file containing the passwords in a secure location and take appropriate measures to protect it from unauthorized access.

If you have any questions or concerns about the privacy policy, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for using my Password Generator!
