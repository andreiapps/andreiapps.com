<h1 class="paragraph">
I, the sole developer of Pong, do not collect any personal information from users of this game. This includes location data, cookies, and any other personally identifiable information.

I understand the importance of user privacy and have designed Pong in a way that does not require or store any personal information. You can play this game without any concerns about your privacy.

Pong does not display any ads, and it does not require internet access to function. As a result, we do not collect any information about your browsing history or online activity. Additionally, Pong does not share any data with third-party advertisers or other entities.

This privacy policy will remain unchanged and in effect for the lifetime of Pong. By continuing to use Pong, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy.
